Homebridge Rituals is a homebridge-plugin to manage a Rituals Genie over homebridge infraestructure.
Homebridge is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API.

Since Siri supports devices added through HomeKit, this means that with Homebridge you can ask Siri to control devices that don't have any support for HomeKit at all. For instance, using just some of the available plugins, you can say:

With this plugin you can do

 * _Siri, turn on the Genie._ 
 * _Siri, turn off the Genie._


#### Before begin, (assumptions)
* Your genie has been registered using Official Rituals App.
* Your genie is working fine. (obviously)
* Your <a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge">homebridge</a> is working fine and has been added to your home app as bridge. If not, please take a look to <a href="#considerations">Installation from zero</a>.

02. Allow to show the fragance name
03. Allow to show the fragance quantity remains inside genie
